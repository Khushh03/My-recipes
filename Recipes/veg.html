            <h4>Why this recipe works</h4>
            <h5>Before I list out and explain to you the beauty of this recipe, let me tell you that this Dal Makhani recipe is one of our most reviewed and loved recipe on the blog.

                It has been made by many of our readers and they have loved it. It also happens to be my most shared recipe on social media.
                
                So what makes this recipe so good and why is it one of the best Dal Makhani recipe.</h5>
            <h4>Whole spices</h4>
            <h5>Fragrant and aromatic whole spices make this Dal Makhani more flavorful.

                In my experimentation with this dish earlier, I remember making dal makhani without whole spices many times and hoping to get restaurant like taste and flavors in the lentils. But it never matched and my experiments continued.
                
                When we were residing in Goa, we used to have dal makhani in a restaurant (and it was one of their best dish) at the quiet and serene Benaulim beach.
                
                I once found a black cardamom and clove in their dal makhni. I thought may be it is the black cardamom and clove giving that lovely aroma and flavor.
                
                Thereafter I tested dal makhani many times adding whole spices and realized that they do add a good flavor and faint aroma to the dish. But I still felt something was lacking.</h5>
                <h4>Butter and cream</h4>
                <h5>Cream and butter make a big difference.

                    Thus I kept on experimenting and when I was testing the recipe of Dal Bukhara, I realized it was the cream and butter giving a rich taste, apart from the slow cooking.
                    
                    The richness in the dish comes from the fats in the butter and cream. The amount of butter and cream added is not copious and just enough to lift the dish in its richness.
                    
                    You could still make dal makhani with less butter and cream. Just remember to slow cook it for longer periods of time, to get the real deal.</h5>
                    <h4>Slow cooking</h4>
                    <h5>The more slow cooked dal makhani is the better it tastes.

                        In most Indian restaurants specializing in authentic North Indian food, Dal Makhani is simmered overnight or for many hours.
                        
                        Basically you can call it slow cooking of the lentils. This slow cooking makes a world of difference to the consistency of the lentils.
                        
                        The lentils are slow cooked in a tandoor. The tandoor is a cylindrical shaped oven made of clay. The fire in the tandoor comes from lit charcoal or wood.
                        
                        Overnight simmering of the dal makhani gives some smokiness in the dish from the charcoal or wood.
                        
                        In most Indian homes you will not find tandoor. But you will easily find a pressure cooker.
                        
                        The fastest way to cook the lentils are in a pressure cooker. In this post, I have used a stove-top pressure cooker, but you can cook the lentils in an Instant Pot too.
                        
                        I have cooked the lentils & beans in a pressure cooker for about 30 minutes. Later I have slow cooked them on a low heat for 25 minutes.
                        
                        You can slow cook for more time than what I have done. Slow cooking makes the lentils viscous, creamy and the end result is a finger-licking dal makhani.</h5>
